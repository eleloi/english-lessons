Welcome to my page! I'm a software developer hailing from the vibrant city of Barcelona. With a passion for creating engaging web experiences, I specialize in both front-end and back-end development. Through this platform, I aim to showcase my skills, share my knowledge, and connect with fellow coding enthusiasts.

In addition to my software development expertise, I'm currently embarking on an exciting journey to learn the English language. As part of this learning process, I'll be providing English lessons right here on this page. Join me as I explore the realms of programming and language acquisition, and let's embark on this enriching adventure together!
